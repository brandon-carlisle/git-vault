## Types of Events and Handlers
An event is basically a signal (something that has happened) that is generated by a certain DOM node. - Eg. A click, mouse moving or keyboard press.
We then listen for these events using event handlers.

JavaScript event references MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_index

Removing event listeners:

## Event Propagation: Bubbling and Capturing
JavaScript events have a capturing phase and bubbling phase.

## Event Delegation: Implementing Page Navigation (smooth scroll)
Here's an example of implementing smooth scroll with JavaScript without event delegation on some nav links that point to different sections of the page:

The problem with this is that we are effectively attaching the same callback function on every nav link element because we are using the forEach method. Not a problem for a small number of elements but if we scale to say a thousand links, it wouldn't be very efficient.

We can solve this with event delegation. In this, we use the fact that events 'bubble up'. We do this by putting the event listener on a common parent of all the elements we are interested in (for example a container containing all the links).

1. Add event listenener to common parent element
2. Determine what element originated the event (the target)
