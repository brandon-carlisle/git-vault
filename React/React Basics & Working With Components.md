## What Are Components? And Why Is React All About Them?
To make building complex UI's, React embraces a concept called 'components'. - React is all about components.

All user interfaces in the end, are made up of components.

Components are - resuable building blocks in your user interface. Components in the end are just a combination of HTML, CSS and possibly JavaScript code (incase you need logic).

You don't have to reuse a component to make it a component, it is just one of its traits that it is reusable.

We build all these individual components and then we tell React how to compose them together into a final UI.

## React Code Is Written In A "Declarative Way"!
React uses a 'declarative' approach for building components.

We just need to define the desired target state(s) and let react figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions.
