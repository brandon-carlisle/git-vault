## Using REPL

In the terminal, we open the Node REPL, by using the node keyword. We can then write any JavaScript we want in here:

We can exit this REPL, we can use .exit, and CTRL D.

If we want to see all the global variable that are available in node, while in the REPL, we can press tab:

We can use the underscore to use the previous value:
