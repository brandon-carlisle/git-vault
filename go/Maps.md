A map is a collection of key - value pairs, like an object in JavaScript.

Both the keys and values are statically typed - 
- All the keys in a map must be of the same type
- All the values in a map must be of the same type
- The keys and values do not need to be of the same type

## Declaring a Map

```go
colors := map[string]string{
	"red": "#FF0000",
	"green": "#00FF00",
	"blue": "#0000FF",
}
```
